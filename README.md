# OF_15 GitHub Repository

## Overview
This is the central workspace where our team collaborates on OpenFOAM simulations and related assignments.

## Team Collaboration
Our team consists of **four members**, and we will be working on separate branches before merging our contributions into the main repository. Each member is responsible for:
- Developing and testing their assigned components in a **personal branch**.
- Regularly committing updates and documenting changes.
- Merging tested and finalized contributions into the **main branch** after review.

## Workflow
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd OF_15
   ```
2. **Create and Switch to Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
3. **Make Changes and Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
4. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
5. **Create a Pull Request (PR) for Review and Merge**
