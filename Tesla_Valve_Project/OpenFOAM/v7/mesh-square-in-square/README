  In this tutorial, we use snappyHexMesh and extrudeMesh
  to produce a 2D mesh around a square in a square domain.
  The square has sides of length 1, it is centered at the origin (0,0).
  The domain is also a square of sides of length 10.

  The square lies in the (x,y) plane with the z coordinate out
  of the plane.
